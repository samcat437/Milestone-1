# User Experience

## Purpose of the Project

**Who is the user?**

The user of this website is an organiser of events living in the UK or anyone that is interested in knowing more about the quartet. They may be brides, grooms, wedding and event planners, or the public. They have an interest in music, and often more specifically, in classical music. 

_Example : Amanda and Paul are getting married at Hensol Castle near Cardiff in August 2022 and are browsing the web for an appropriate group for their event. They found the Avon String Quartet on Facebook and have looked them up online._

**What does the user want?**

The user wants to hire a string quartet for their event quickly and easily within their budget. When first visiting the site, they want to envision the event and the specific moments that the string quartet would enhance. They want to be able to see prices/packages on the site and make an enquiry. They may make multiple visits to the site while looking at competitors.

_Example : They land on the ASQ’s webpage after searching their name in Google and are captured by the hero image video. They navigate to the **Wedding > Prices and Packages** section and can see that the group's services are within their budget. They then navigate to the enquiry section, where after filling it out they get feedback that the ASQ will be in touch with them within 24 hours to further discuss their booking._

**What is the benefit of the product?**

By hiring the Avon String Quartet, the user’s event will be enhanced by conservatoire-trained classical musicians who are able to perform a broad repertoire of music and who will work with the user to create a bespoke experience.  It will create lasting memories for the user and impress their guests. 

_Example : The couple are wowed on their wedding day. As arranged, the quartet performed at the ceremony, playing the couple's favourite song while the bride walks down the aisle in addition to thirty minutes of pre-ceremony music, music for signing of the register and exit music, and then performances of different repertoire during cocktail hour and wedding breakfast. The couple remember these moments for the rest of their lives._
